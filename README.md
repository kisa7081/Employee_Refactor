# Employee_Refactor
Demonstration of OOP concepts


In the demo.simple package is an Employee class with a part-time flag added.  This seemed a bit too simple, so I created three classes that implement an IEmployee interface and a factory to create them.  A demonstration of the factory and the different classes can be seen by running the main method in the demo.main.Main class.
